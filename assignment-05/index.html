        Kristy Thomas forms a group with her best friends to make money and take care of children in their local neighborhood.  The series is long and each book in the series rotates between the cast of friends in the club.  The series was already somewhat antiquated when I started reading it in the early 2000s, but taught me a lot about the trials of young adulthood.

        Kristy is the main character and founder of the club.  She is bossy, but brilliant.

        Mary Anne is Kristy's best friend.  She is shy, but the first to have a boyfriend.

        Claudia used to be close with Mary Anne and Kristy, but she is now more mature.  She is a Japanese-American artist and boy-crazy.

        Stacey is the newest member of the group.  She is from New York City.  Her life seems glamarous, but she has a secret.
