1.  There are many forms on website that I frequent.  For instance, all social media websites require a log-in form for user name and password.  This is required for security authenticity.  
Of all the form inputs, text input is the most simple.  You can also input passwords.  This kind of form can be used for log-ins.  Next is selection input.  This can be used to allow a user to make a choice.  One example of this kind of input is a multiple choice quiz on a website.  Finally, there is button input, which is more graphically interesting, and can be used for many purposes on websites.  For instance, you can add an upload button that allows a user to upload a file as their answer to a prompt.  
My work cycle for this week's assignment was similar to last weeks.  I am feeling a lot more confident this week and last now that I have a better understanding of how github desktop works and how to sample how my .index file in a web browser as I"m working along.  I watched the class video and read through all of the class website.  Then I worked through your example and some of the examples in the class website to write my html.  Once it was working in my browswer, I experimented with some additional style elements to make it look a little more visiually appealing, even though it is still very basic.
