1. The head can have several different elements.  These include Meta, Viewport, Title, Link, and Style.  For now we learned about charset, Description, and Author as the types of Meta head elements.  The body has two categories of elements, structural and semantic elements.  
2. Structural markup determines how the browser will structure information.  Semantic markup lets the browser know the meaning of the document in a different way, beyond just the structural look.  For example, italics are usually what we understand to be emphasized words.  So in semantic markup, we use the emphasize element instead of the italic element.  This imbues the document with meaning.  
3. For this work cycle, I first watched the week 6 overview.  Then I read through the course guide, while also attempting to go through the homework assignment alongside it in atom.  I used some elements of your example code, but tried to do a better job this week of typing it all out myself and really understanding what each tag means.
