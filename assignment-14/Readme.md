1. What library did you choose?
I chose bootstrap because it seemed like the most prevalent library and the easiest to download and important.
2. Did you use a local file or CDN? Why?
I used a CDN, I think. I am a little confused. I think CDNs use Java.
3. How does HTML5 change the web?
HTML5 improves and streamlines a lot of issues with HTML.  Complexitivity and the use of Canvas are two of the most important changes to the web.  Canvas uses Javascript to add graphics, and it also reduces security vulnerabilities.  
4.  Free Response: Please discuss your challenges and how you overcame them.
I have been trying to fix a lot of issues with this week's assignment, and I have decided to submit it as it is for now, in order to see if you can assist me with some of my problems.  I guess I just really don't understand libraries.  I did download Bootstrap and I added the same files to my assignment that I saw you had added.  There were just so many choices from what I had downloaded and I didn't understand how to know which ones to use.  I also don't understand what happens to my other style sheet...do my changes, like color, not show up anymore from my CSS style sheet.  Hopefully, I can figure some of this out for my final assignment.  Thank you.
