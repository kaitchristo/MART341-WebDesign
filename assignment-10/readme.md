The  universal, element, class, and id selector types are all important when using CSS. The selector lets the browser know what element the rule applies to in the code.  The universal selector applies to every element on the page with a *, whereas the element selector only applies to certain elements that you choose by writing the element name first, (ex h1).  Finally, the class can be applied with a . to show a specific way you'd like certain elements to look.  In the same way, you can select an ID to choose to style certain ids.  
I chose to use several 'grunge' aesthetic colors.  I used black, lightsteelblue, and darkgrey.
This week I am a little late because it is a busy week for me.  This week seemed somewhat easier than last weeks, but I relied on the example a lot...hope that's okay.  Trying to catch up now.  Looking forward to the next lesson I am about to start.
