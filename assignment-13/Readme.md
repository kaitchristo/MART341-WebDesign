1. The imaginary client was me! This would be for a bar I would like to open someday.  My site needs are an easy to read website with up to date food and drink options, a contact form for reservations for large parties, and a red color motif to match the look and lighting of the bar.  
2. A mobile first design is important to consider because so much of modern browsing happens on mobile, especially at a restaurant or bar, where one might use their phone to peruse the menu or cocktail list.  
3. My challenges this week were understanding how to make pictures smaller.  I was able to use Preview to resize my placeholder photos.  Another challenge was understanding how to get pictures to scroll or stay in the same spot.  I feel like I still don't understand why my generated text does not scroll down when I change the size of the page.
