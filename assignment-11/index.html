<strong>Loving you is every bit as fine</strong><br/>
as coming over a hill into the sun<br/>
at ninety miles an hour darling when<br/>
it’s dawn and you can hear the stars unlocking<br/>
themselves from the designs of God beneath<br/>
the disintegrating orchestra of my black<br/>
Chevrolet. The radio clings to an un-<br/>
identified station—somewhere a tango suffers,<br/>
and the dance floor burns around two lovers<br/>
whom nothing can touch—no, not even death!<br/>
Oh! the acceleration with which my heart does proceed,<br/>
reaching like stars almost but never quite<br/>
of light the speed of light the speed of light.<br/>
