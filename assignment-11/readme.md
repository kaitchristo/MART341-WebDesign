1. A system font, a web font, and a web-safe font are all different options for your CSS stylesheet. Web fonts will not always work, but web-safe fonts are a pretty sure bet because almost all browsers and computers will have them installed by default.  Some system fonts only work on Mac or Windows or Linux.  
2. You should have a fallback font or a font stack because different browsers might not be able to load certain fonts.  For this reason, it is important to have a back up plan for the browser.  It can even be a chain of backups, in other words, a font stack, to ensure that the website loads correctly for your user.
3. This week I had some challenges understanding how to add my self-hosted font. At first I didn't understand that I needed a separate folder for my downloaded fonts.  The videos were helpful.  I like the idea of being able to choose from many more fonts than the basic ones most browsers will recognize by default, so I see the importance of hosting your own fonts.
