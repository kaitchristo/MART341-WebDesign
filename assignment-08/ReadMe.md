1. Divs, classes, ids, and spans all help to organize  a page.  Divs and Spans are elements and classes and ids are attributes. Ids identify what stands out about a particular element. They must all be unique. Within an id, you can add a class to identify a group of similar elements.  Unlike unique ids, you can have more than one class for a single element.  While div at its most basic will create a new line, it also groups elements together. A span occurs within a div.  It creates a visually unique group within the div.  Both divs and spans need id or class attributes.  
2. The advantage of using a service to host your videos is that you do not have pay to host them yourself and you have access to such a wide array of content.  A disadvantage is potential copyright claim from the original poster.  In addition, there may be limits on plays and the content could be taken down at any time.  
3. This week I struggled to get my embedded audio to show up as well as the Media Arts package.  I realize now that certain media types might not display properly in Atom, but will work in my browser preview.  This was a very busy week for me, thank you for the extra time on this assignment!
